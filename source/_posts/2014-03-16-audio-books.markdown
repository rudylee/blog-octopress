Around October 2013, I decided to move from city to Gladesville which located 9 kilometres north-west of Sydney CBD. It wasn't easy decision because I need to spend about 2 hours on commuting every day. 

For the first couple months, I was fine with the long commuting time. I can distract myself with my phone or sleeping on the bus. However, I started to feel unproductive and I can feel it affected my concentration throughout the day. So, I tried to do some research on the Internet about productive use of commuting time. Most of the articles that I found suggesting to listen either podcasts or audio books. 

I decided to give audio book a try and downloaded [Eat That Frog by Brian Tracy](http://www.amazon.com/Eat-That-Frog-Great-Procrastinating/dp/1576754227). If you are interested, you can easily find the audio version of this book on YouTube. At first, I was a little bit skeptical with the result but it turned out to be really helpful. I can feel that my life is back on track again. I started to use [Trello](http://trello.com/) to keep my list of tasks. Once in a while, I'll update my goals and create separate boards for each project.  

Since that, I have been listening to several different audio books such as [168 hours by Laura Vanderkam](http://www.amazon.com/168-Hours-Have-More-Think/dp/159184410X) and [Getting things done by David Allen](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280). Both of them shared some basic principles from Eat that frog. I prefer Getting things done because it's more straight forward and focusing on actions you can perform to improve your productivity. Although, I can say that this book is quite to hard understand so you need to listen it more than once to get a good grasp of the concept.
