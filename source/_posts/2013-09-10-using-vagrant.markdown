Vagrant is open-source software for creating and configuring virtual development environments. It can be considered a wrapper around VirtualBox and configuration management software such as Chef, Salt and Puppet. Although written in Ruby, it is usable in projects written in other languages such as PHP, Python, Java, and C#

For the past few weeks, I started to use Vagrant heavily in my development process. One of the reasons is I want to use Linux as my main development environment. However, I also need to use Adobe Photoshop in my daily work and Linux does not support Adobe Photoshop natively. 

With Vagrant, I can easily create virtual machine.
