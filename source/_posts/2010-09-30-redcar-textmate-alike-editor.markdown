It's been a long time since the last time I am using e-texteditor as my primary text editor ( e-texteditor is a textmate alike editor for Windows ). And because I decided to use Linux, I have to find another editor and now I ended up using Eclipse. In Linux, obviously, there are several text editor but the features doesn't fit my needs.   

But now there is a new text editor that written in Ruby and runs on JRuby and it's features are inspired by Textmate : [Redcar](http://redcareditor.com/). Actually, I already tried to use redcar last year and at that time the features are not as complete as now. 

You can follow the development through it's [github repository](http://github.com/redcar/redcar). The author Dan, is very active and looks like he commit often :) 

As far as I tested, the bundles support is good enough in compare with e-texteditor ( I am using version 0.5.1 ) and bundles is the top reason why I like using Textmate-alike editor. Looking forward to use it as my primary text editor in Linux.
