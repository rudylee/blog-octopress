I spent some time last weekend to run throught new AngularJS course by Code School. This course is sponsored by Google which means you don't need to pay for the Code School membership to play this course. AngularJS is one of the popular Javascript frameworks to build single page app application. You might familiar with other similar frameworks such as Ember.js, Backbone.js and Knockout.js. 

After finishing the course, I can say that I really enjoyed it and definitely learned something from it. It covers the basic concept about directives, services and dependecy injection that I missed when the first time I learned about AngularJS. 

In the early days of learning AngularJS, I tend to copy and paste snippet of code without understand what is the meaning behind it. This causes confusion when I tried to dive deep into the framework because I didn't understand the concept
