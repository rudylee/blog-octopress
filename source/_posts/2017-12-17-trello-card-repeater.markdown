I've been using Trello as my primary task managers for the past couple of years.  Recently, I found a very useful feature in Trello that helps me automating the creation of repetitive tasks. 

This feature allows you to tell Trello to create a card on specified time such as daily, weekly, monthly or annually. 

At the moment, I am using this feature to create a few daily tasks that I want to do first in the morning such as meditation, coding exercise and learning chinese. 

I am not a disciplined person and I found that this feature has been helping me forming new habits. I set it to put the tasks on the top of my todo list which makes it difficult for me to ignore those tasks in the morning.

Research says it takes around 66 days for a new habit to form. I suggest you to try this feature if you want to create a new habit and make it part of daily routine.
