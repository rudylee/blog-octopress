Today, I decided to upload my new blog using Octopress into live. I have spent the last two weeks migrating my blog posts into Octopress. The process was not as smooth as I thought. I had to check every single blog post and re-apply all the code snippet tags, fix typo and add missing post. 

After all, I am quite happy with the end result. I can easily add new blog post through terminal and edit the post using my current favourite text editor Vim. The other good thing is the beautiful code snippet which is one of the reasons I moved from Wordpress. 

I am looking forward to post more tutorials about PHP, Rails, NodeJS, AngularJS and so on.
