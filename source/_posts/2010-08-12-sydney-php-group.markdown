[Sydney PHP Group or sydphp](http://sydphp.org) is a PHP community in Sydney, Australia. I found the website when I was reading an article in [Graham Weldon's blog](http://www.grahamweldon.com). Graham is one of the CakePHP core team and also the organisers of Sydney PHP Group. 

From what I read, it's said that they run regular meetings in the city. But when I clicked it, it didn't show any histories or upcoming events ( maybe they not runs it regularly as they said ). That's fine at least I found already one of the PHP community in Australia, yay :) plus it has the job vacancies post in it ( so I think I won't have any difficulty to find any freelancer job if I were in Sydney ). :D
