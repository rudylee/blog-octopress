Basically Gource is a command line tool that you can use to visualize your project's progress that using software version control. Here is the example of my project :



Cool isn't it ? In my video, there is only one person because I am working for this project alone. However, if you are looking in YouTube, you can find a lot of big projects that using Gource to visualize their progress. One of the project that you should see is the Linux Kernel project.
