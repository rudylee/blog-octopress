Data store is an important piece in most of the modern applications. The implementation can range from a simple text file to complicated database systems. In this blog post, I will show you how to use Google Spreadsheet as a data store for your application. 

Google Spreadsheet provides a convenient way to store, edit, share and retrieve data. This makes Google Spreadsheet appealing if you want to quickly prototype an app and don't want to spend time building a CRUD system to manage your data. It also allow you to output the spreadsheet data in JSON format. This means you can so Google Spreadsheet as your JSON API.

# Publish the spreadsheet to the web

In order to enable this feature, first you need to publish the spreadsheet to the web. You can easily do this by going to the File menu and choose Publish to the web. See the screenshot below.

# Get the ID of the spreadsheet

The next thing that you have to do is getting the spreadsheet ID from the URL.

The URL of your spreadsheet should be something like this https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17CAMo4mY7pdlk7jgV2385FLVzDV3L8cUDidhfge8U_J4/edit#gid=0

The spreadsheet ID is the characters between the `d` and `edit`, which in example above is `17CAMo4mY7pdlk7jgV2385FLVzDV3L8cUDidhfge8U_J4`

# Copy the ID and construct the JSON API endpoint

After retrieving the ID, you can construct the API endpoint. The URL format as follow:

```
https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/replace-this-with-your-spreadsheet-id/od6/public/values?alt=json
```




https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/17CAMo4mY7pdlk7jgVRmgD5FLVzDV3L8cUDiHaT8U_J4/od6/public/values?alt=json

Spreadsheet URL: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17CAMo4mY7pdlk7jgVRmgD5FLVzDV3L8cUDiHaT8U_J4/edit#gid=0

JSON API: https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/17CAMo4mY7pdlk7jgVRmgD5FLVzDV3L8cUDiHaT8U_J4/od6/public/values?alt=json

# The spreadsheet is public but not published to the web

You can use `importrange` formula to get the data from another spreadsheet and import it into your spreadsheet

=importrange("URL-TO-SPREADSHEET", "SHEET NAME!CELL RANGE")

For Example:
=importrange("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ql32s8kcUB-Q8AEwxrCzPYJzNgaQ2CknW4J0rlnJqfE","SBW Optimal Conversions!A1:I190")
